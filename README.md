Navigation App Assistance using React/JS

XOS Electric Truck Dashboard Navigation App

A cross-platform desktop application built using React and Electron framework to provide effective navigation for XOS Electric Trucks. The app was integrated with Google Maps API to meet the client's specific navigation requirements. The app runs on both Windows and x86 configurations, and a distributable app image was created using modified JSON parameters for the KANZI framework.

The project was a collaborative effort, with the team effectively communicating and continuously learning throughout the project. The challenge of limited access to the KANZI framework was successfully overcome by using React and Electron to create a distributable app image. This resulted in the successful completion of the project and the satisfaction of the sprint requirements requested by the client.
